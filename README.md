# Customer Bundle Parser
## A simple python application to extract relevant Salesforce data from a customer diagnostic bundle

### Instructions

- Clone the repo
- Make the "parser.sh" script executable
- Place diagnostic bundle(s) in the "bundle" dir
- Run parser.sh

### Limitations

- The script currently parses only DKP2.0 and above
- The logic is pretty jenky in places as there are no obvious and consistent fields to target for many of the data points
- Feedback to @dwhitehouse
